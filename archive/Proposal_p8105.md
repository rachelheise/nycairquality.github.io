**The tentative project title**

A descriptive and visual exploration of air quality and mobility data in
NYC 2020 year-to-date

**The motivation for this project**

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated longstanding inequity in our
society and dramatically shifted social, economic, and environmental
patterns in NYC. As COVID-19 epidemiological patterns have shifted, so
too have the city’s policy guidance and residents’ behavior. To better
understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on NYC’s social ecology,
we examine air quality and mobility trends over time in relation to
public health guidance to stay home and cease all non-essential business
function.

**The intended final products**

  - Interactive website with About, Dashboard, Findings, Discussion, and
    References sections
    
      - Data are to be presented with static and interactive plots,
        exploring smoothed mobility and air quality trends over time
        with reference to city-wide COVID-19 guidance
    
      - Options to filter the data and focus on specific aspects of
        mobility and/or air quality trends will be available
    
      - Results will report and detail EDA results, and Discussion will
        summarize and synthesize Results with commentary and
        implications from authors
    
      - Depending on the success of this section, authors are interested
        in doing a comparative exploration of NYC data year-to-date with
        a previous year, to help clarify which trends may be
        attributable to seasonality rather than COVID-19

**The anticipated data sources**

  - NYC Air Quality Data
    (<https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-publications/air-quality-nyc-community-air-survey.page>)
    
      - <https://aqicn.org/data-platform/covid19/> or other alternative
        if necessary

  - Government Lockdown Mandates
    (<https://www.acaps.org/covid-19-government-measures-dataset>)

  - Google’s Regional Mobility Data
    (<https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/>)
    
      - PDF with visualizations they made
        (<https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-10-30_US_New_York_Mobility_Report_en.pdf>)

**The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges**

  - Successful GitHub collaboration schema

  - Cleaning and synthesizing multiple datasets from different sources,
    and generating a useful and reproducible dataset and data dictionary

  - Generating and polishing graphs displaying mobility, air quality,
    and policy trends over time that can be interactively filtered by
    users Providing adaptable and multifaceted visualizations without
    sacrificing user legibility and utility

  - Translating EDA into clear and concise Results

**Visualizations:**

  - Smoothed time series of air quality in NYC over time

  - Smoothed time series of COVID-19 infection rates in NYC over time

  - Smoothed time series of individual-level mobility rates in NYC over
    time

  - Simple demarcations over time of NYC COVID-19 policy guidance
    changes

  - Simultaneous overlay of the above

  - Table(s) of descriptive statistics as needed

**The planned timeline**

  - Planning/data cleaning, 11/7-11/14

  - Initial setup of website and basic plots, 11/15-11/20

  - Review plots and revise visualizations if needed, 11/23

  - Continue working on plots, 11/23-11/30

  - Rough draft of report, 11/23-11/30

  - Final draft of report, 11/30-12/5

  - Record screencast, 12/2

  - Deadline,12/5/2020 at 4pm
