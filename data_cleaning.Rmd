# Setup

```{r, include = F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#Load relevant libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)
#Theming with viridis, minimal
theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)
scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```



## COVID Case Data

Reading in the data and basic cleaning.

```{r import_cases, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
nyc_cases =
  GET("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/rc75-m7u3.csv") %>% # Reading in the data
  content("parsed") %>% 
  rename(date = date_of_interest) %>% # Renaming the date variable for simplicity
  select(date, case_count) %>% # Only retaining date and case count for simplicity
  mutate(
    date = as.Date(date, tryFormats = c("%Y-%m-%d")) # as.Date() by default cannot convert POSIXct to date; no data lost
  )
## Note: This dataset also contains hospitalized count and death count.
## I removed those measures for now for simplicity, but we can always decide to retain them later if we think they would be useful.
```

Trying out a simple plot of cases over time.

```{r clean_cases}
nyc_cases %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = case_count, color = case_count)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = .2) +
    geom_line(alpha = .75, size = .75) +
      scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b %y") +
      scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 6500, 500)) +
  labs(
    title = "COVID-19 New Cases Per Day, NYC, 2020",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Case Count (Persons)",
    caption = "Examining COVID-19 Incidence, P8105 Final Project") 

```

## Air Quality Data

```{r}

```
