## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated longstanding inequity in our society and dramatically shifted social, economic, and environmental patterns in NYC. As COVID-19 epidemiological patterns have shifted, so too have the city’s policy guidance and residents’ behavior. To better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on NYC’s social ecology, we examine air quality trends over time in relation to public health guidance to stay home and cease all non-essential business function.
